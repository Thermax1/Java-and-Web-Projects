# CS612-Assignment4

- In this assignment, I created a simple React page. The left side is 3 blog posts of my personal thoughts. You can click the title of each blog post to read the actual article. The right side has a link to the site and articles from Google News.
- To run this, download the zip and put it in a folder. You have to enter that directory in your terminal and run the command `npm start` assuming you have NodeJS installed on your system.
  - Otherwise, install NodeJS first then run `npm start` inside your terminal while in the directory of munoz-blog.
