# Java XML Parser

- Here, we create a custom xml, dtd, and xml schema
- We created two DOM parsers, one that validates the dtd to the xml and the other validates the schema to the xml
- If any errors occur, that means that your dtd or schema does not match up with the xml and needs to be fixed.
- A simple text statement will appear in the console if everything is correct

## How to Run

- Once JDK is defined, you can just run the .java files in IntelliJ or Eclipse.
